## Dan Groze    

  I've recently finished the Makers Academy coding course, one of Europe's top software engineering bootcamps, currently going through the pleasures and challenges of learning to be a programmer.
  Looking forward to advancing my coding skills, meeting like-minded people in a work-friendly environment.

## Skills

#### Working well under pressure

  Being used to deadlines and high-volume demands from working as a car wash manager, I've developed an attitude
that allows me to focus and keep delivering an excellent service while encountering stressful situations. This 
has taught me to not give up easily on a task, persistence gives results.
  This mindset helped me boost my car-wash sales by 35% in a period of just 3 years.

#### Good communication

  Having worked within a customer service based environment for the last 7 years, I've developed an ability to
convey my thoughts in a concise, direct manner. During my time working as a hotel receptionist, I've learned to 
communicate professionally with customers from all around the world. This helped me in my future jobs and projects
by having the ability to lead a team and training my teammates to my likeness.
  
## Education

#### Makers Academy (jan 2019 - apr 2019)

During my coding journey so far, I've developed software mostly while pair programming, using practices like TDD (test driven development), followed the agile process with 2-day sprints for the major projects, and integrated the kanban board for team coordination and communication.

Technologies that I'm familiar with include: 

- JavaScript
- React 
- Node
- Ruby on Rails

* Databases: 
- Postgres
- NoSQL(MongoDB, Firebase)

* Testing frameworks
- Rspec
- Capybara
- Jasmine
- Jest
- Cypress 

#### Civil Engineering 3 year unfinished degree (2007-2010)

** Subjects studied
- Engineering, Maths, Physics , Computer Science, Commercial Law, Statistics
 
  Although it took me 3 full years to figure out that I don't want to have a carreer as a civil engineer, this period
has taught me how to live on my own, to be independent and it has helped me figure out who I was and what I want to 
focus my attention on in order to succeed in life.
